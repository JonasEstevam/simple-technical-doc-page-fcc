            Each and every value in JavaScript has a set of behaviors you can
            observe from running different operations. That sounds abstract, but
            as a quick example, consider some operations we might run on a
            variable named <code>message.</code>
          </p>
          <code class="code-box">
            <i class="code-line code-comment"
              >// Accessing the property 'toLowerCase'</i
            >
            <i class="code-line code-comment"
              >// on 'message' and then calling it</i
            >
            <i class="code-line">message.toLowerCase();</i>
            <i class="code-line code-comment">// Calling 'message'</i>
            <i class="code-line">message();</i>
          </code>
          <p>
            If we break this down, the first runnable line of code accesses a
            property called <code>toLowerCase</code> and then calls it. The
            second one tries to call <code>message</code> directly.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is <code>message</code> callable?</li>
            <li>If both of these values are callable, what do they return?</li>
            <li>
              Does it have a property called <code>toLowerCase</code> on it?
            </li>
            <li>If it does, is <code>toLowerCase</code> even callable?</li>
            <li>If both of these values are callable, what do they return?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The answers to these questions are usually things we keep in our
            heads when we write JavaScript, and we have to hope we got all the
            details right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s say <code>message</code> was defined in the following way.
          </p>
          <code class="code-box">
            <i class="code-line">const message = "Hello World!";</i>
          </code>
          <p>
            As you can probably guess, if we try to run message.toLowerCase(),
            we’ll get the same string only in lower-case.
          </p>
          <p>
            What about that second line of code? If you’re familiar with
            JavaScript, you’ll know this fails with an exception:
          </p>
          <code class="error-box">
            <p>TypeError: message is not a function</p>
          </code>
          <p>It’d be great if we could avoid mistakes like this.</p>
          <p>
            When we run our code, the way that our JavaScript runtime chooses
            what to do is by figuring out the type of the value - what sorts of
            behaviors and capabilities it has. That’s part of what that
            <code>TypeError</code> is alluding to - it’s saying that the string
            <code>"Hello World"</code>
            cannot be called as a function.
          </p>
          <p>
            For some values, such as the primitives <code>string</code> and
            <code>number</code>, we can identify their type at runtime using the
            <code>typeof</code> operator. But for other things like functions,
            there’s no corresponding runtime mechanism to identify their types.
            For example, consider this function:
          </p>
          <code class="code-box">
            <i class="code-line"> function fn(x) { </i>
            <i class="code-line"> return x.flip(); </i>
            <i class="code-line"> } </i>
          </code>
          <p>
            We can observe by reading the code that this function will only work
            if given an object with a callable <code>flip</code> property, but
            JavaScript doesn’t surface this information in a way that we can
            check while the code is running. The only way in pure JavaScript to
            tell what <code>fn</code> does with a particular value is to call it
            and see what happens. This kind of behavior makes it hard to predict
            what code will do before it runs, which means it’s harder to know
            what your code is going to do while you’re writing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seen in this way, a type is the concept of describing which values
            can be passed to <code>fn</code> and which will crash. JavaScript
            only truly provides dynamic typing - running the code to see what
            happens.
          </p>
          <p>
            The alternative is to use a <code>static</code> type system to make
            predictions about what code is expected before it runs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Think back to that TypeError we got earlier from trying to call a
            string as a function. Most people don’t like to get any sorts of
            errors when running their code - those are considered bugs! And when
            we write new code, we try our best to avoid introducing new bugs.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we add just a bit of code, save our file, re-run the code, and
            immediately see the error, we might be able to isolate the problem
            quickly; but that’s not always the case. We might not have tested
            the feature thoroughly enough, so we might never actually run into a
            potential error that would be thrown! Or if we were lucky enough to
            witness the error, we might have ended up doing large refactorings
            and adding a lot of different code that we’re forced to dig through.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ideally, we could have a tool that helps us find these bugs before
            our code runs. That’s what a static type-checker like TypeScript
            does. Static types systems describe the shapes and behaviors of what
            our values will be when we run our programs. A type-checker like
            TypeScript uses that information and tells us when things might be
            going off the rails.
          </p>
          <div class="error-after-code">
            <code class="code-box">
              <i class="code-line">const message = "hello!";</i>
              <i class="code-line">message();</i>
            </code>
            <div class="error-box">
              <p>
                This expression is not callable. <br />Type 'String' has no call

              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Running that last sample with TypeScript will give us an error
            message before we run the code in the first place.

        <div class="section-body">
          <p>
            So far we’ve been discussing certain things like runtime errors -
            cases where the JavaScript runtime tells us that it thinks something
            is nonsensical. Those cases come up because the ECMAScript
            specification has explicit instructions on how the language should
            behave when it runs into something unexpected.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the specification says that trying to call something
            that isn’t callable should throw an error. Maybe that sounds like
            “obvious behavior”, but you could imagine that accessing a property
            that doesn’t exist on an object should throw an error too. Instead,
            JavaScript gives us different behavior and returns the value
            undefined:
          </p>

          <code class="code-box">
            <i class="code-line">const user = { </i>
            <i class="code-line"> name: "Daniel", </i>
            <i class="code-line"> age: 26, </i>
            <i class="code-line">};</i>
            <br />
            <i class="code-line">user.location;</i>
            <i class="code-line code-comment">// returns undefined</i>
          </code>
          <p>
            Ultimately, a static type system has to make the call over what code
            should be flagged as an error in its system, even if it’s “valid”
            JavaScript that won’t immediately throw an error. In TypeScript, the
            following code produces an error about location not being defined:
          </p>
          <div class="error-after-code">
            <code class="code-box">
              <i class="code-line">const user = { </i>
              <i class="code-line"> name: "Daniel", </i>
              <i class="code-line"> age: 26, </i>
              <i class="code-line">};</i>
              <br />
              <i class="code-line">user.location;</i>
            </code>
            <div class="error-box">
              <p>
                Property 'location' does not exist on type '{ name: string; age:
                number; }'.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            While sometimes that implies a trade-off in what you can express,
            the intent is to catch legitimate bugs in our programs. And
            TypeScript catches a lot of legitimate bugs.
          </p>
          <p>For example: typos,</p>

          <code class="code-box">
            <i class="code-line">const announcement = "Hello World!";</i>
            <br />
            <i class="code-line code-comment"
              >// How quickly can you spot the typos?</i
            >
            <i class="code-line">announcement.toLocaleLowercase();</i>
            <i class="code-line">announcement.toLocalLowerCase();</i>
            <br />
            <i class="code-line code-comment"
              >// We probably meant to write this:</i
            >
            <i class="code-line">announcement.toLocaleLowercase();</i>
          </code>
          <p>uncalled functions,</p>
          <div class="error-after-code">
            <code class="code-box">
              <i class="code-line">function flipCoin() { </i>

            TypeScript can catch bugs when we make mistakes in our code. That’s
            great, but TypeScript can also prevent us from making those mistakes
            in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            The type-checker has information to check things like whether we’re
            accessing the right properties on variables and other properties.
            Once it has that information, it can also start suggesting which
            properties you might want to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            That means TypeScript can be leveraged for editing code too, and the
            core type-checker can provide error messages and code completion as
            you type in the editor. That’s part of what people often refer to
            when they talk about tooling in TypeScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            TypeScript takes tooling seriously, and that goes beyond completions
            and errors as you type. An editor that supports TypeScript can
            deliver “quick fixes” to automatically fix errors, refactorings to
            easily re-organize code, and useful navigation features for jumping
            to definitions of a variable, or finding all references to a given
            variable. All of this is built on top of the type-checker and is
            fully cross-platform, so it’s likely that

        <div class="section-body">
          <p>
            We’ve been talking about type-checking, but we haven’t yet used our
            type-checker. Let’s get acquainted with our new friend tsc, the
            TypeScript compiler. First we’ll need to grab it via npm.
          </p>

          <div class="command-box"><p>npm install -g typeScript</p></div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p>
              This installs the TypeScript Compiler tsc globally. You can use
              npx or similar tools if you’d prefer to run tsc from a local
              node_modules package instead.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Now let’s move to an empty folder and try writing our first
            TypeScript program: hello.ts:
          </p>
          <code class="code-box">
            <i class="code-line code-comment">// Greets the world</i>
            <i class="code-line">console.log("Hello World!");</i>
          </code>
          <p>
            Notice there are no frills here; this “hello world” program looks
            identical to what you’d write for a “hello world” program in
            JavaScript. And now let’s type-check it by running the command tsc
            which was installed for us by the typescript package.
          </p>
          <div class="command-box"><p>tsc hello.ts</p></div>
          <p>Tada!</p>
          <p>
            Wait, “tada” what exactly? We ran tsc and nothing happened! Well,
            there were no type errors, so we didn’t get any output in our
            console since there was nothing to report.
          </p>
          <p>
            But check again - we got some file output instead. If we look in our
            current directory, we’ll see a hello.js file next to hello.ts.
            That’s the output from our hello.ts file after tsc compiles or
            transforms it into a plain JavaScript file. And if we check the
            contents, we’ll see what TypeScript spits out after it processes a
            .ts file:
          </p>
          <code class="code-box">
            <i class="code-line code-comment">// Greets the world</i>
            <i class="code-line">console.log("Hello World!");</i>
          </code>
          <p>
            In this case, there was very little for TypeScript to transform, so
            it looks identical to what we wrote. The compiler tries to emit
            clean readable code that looks like something a person would write.
            While that’s not always so easy, TypeScript indents consistently, is
            mindful of when our code spans across different lines of code, and
            tries to keep comments around.
          </p>
          <p>
            What about if we did introduce a type-checking error? Let’s rewrite
            hello.ts:
          </p>
          <code class="code-box">
            <i class="code-line code-comment"
              >// This is an industrial-grade general-purpose greeter function:

            If we run tsc hello.ts again, notice that we get an error on the
            command line!

          <div class="error-box"><p>Expected 2 arguments, but got 1.</p></div>
          <p>
            TypeScript is telling us we forgot to pass an argument to the greet
            function, and rightfully so. So far we’ve only written standard
            JavaScript, and yet type-checking was still able to find problems
            with our code. Thanks TypeScript!
